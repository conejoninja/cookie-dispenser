An automatic cookie dispenser for my bunny

Print .STL files on your 3D printer, glue them together. To join both bars, I used a cut nail, drill a hole in both bars, sand a little bit the bottom of the short one, so the head nail fill in it. Add a drop of glue on the long bar, the nail will be glue to the long one, while it could rotate freely on the short bar.
